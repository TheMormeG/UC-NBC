# User Category-aware Naive Bayes Classifier

This repository contains an implementation of a User Category-aware Naive Bayes Classifier.
It includes two Python scripts:

- Improved_bayes_matrix: A simple Python implementation used to check the final results of the classifier.
- Improved_bayes_plot: A script for visualizing the illustrations from the related paper.

### Current Version
The current version is a basic implementation without any object-oriented structure.
It is a straightforward, functional implementation meant for initial exploration.

### Future Updates
In future versions, we plan to include an object-oriented Python implementation
to enhance the modularity and reusability of the code.

```
### Usage

1. Install required packages from requirements.txt file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run Improved_bayes_matrix.py file to obtain the mae. You can configure some training parameters through the command line.
```bash
python Improved_bayes_matrix.py -d ciao/movielens_100k --five_folds True/False
```

Feel free to use and modify this code, and stay tuned for future updates!
